# Zielona Budowa

Unfinished project. **Zielona Budowa** was built as a website of a small architecture studio meant to showcase the companyâ€™s designs. A demo of the current version can be seen [here] (https://zielonabudowa.netlify.com).

## Technologies used

* **React.js**
* **React-Router**
* **React-Bootstrap**
* **SCSS**

## A few words about the project

The website has a minimalistic design with a white background divided into two main sections, the left portion containing the logo, menu and contact details and the right one displaying a gallery of images. On smaller screens, the left portion of the screen is replaced by a navigation bar at the top, with the menu and contact details available after clicking a button. The menu and gallery are created dynamically using **React**.

The project was scrapped due to extraordinary circumstances.
