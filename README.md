## A few words about the project

The website has a minimalistic design with a white background divided into two main sections, the left portion containing the logo, menu and contact details and the right one displaying a gallery of images. On smaller screens, the left portion of the screen is replaced by a navigation bar at the top, with the menu and contact details available after clicking a button. The menu and gallery are created dynamically using **React**.
